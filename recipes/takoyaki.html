        <h2>Steps to make Takoyaki</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Slice the octopus into small p bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>In a bowl combine the plain and corn flour in a bowl, then in a separate bowl whisk the egg</li>
            <li>Add the egg to the dry mixture, then pour in the dashi stock or water and whisk</li>
            <li>Now, heat the takoyaki pan on medium-high heat and pass oil gently over the entire surface</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the center of the pan and pour until all the holes are full the batter covers the entire plate</li>
            <li>Place a piece of octopus or chicken into each hole, then sporadically spread the spring onion, ginger and tempura crumbs<br> across the pan</li>
            <li>Move your chopstick in an ‘L’ shape around each hole, then immediately push down into the well to flip the batter, 
                <br>forming a rough ball shape as you go.</li>
            <li>Keep on flipping each ball until the batter is crisp and shows a golden brown on all sides</li>
